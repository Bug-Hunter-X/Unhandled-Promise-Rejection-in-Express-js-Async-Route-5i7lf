This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled promise rejections in asynchronous routes. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, where an asynchronous operation (`someAsyncOperation`) lacks proper error handling, leading to a generic 500 server error without specific details on the failure.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling, ensuring informative error responses to the client and avoiding server crashes.
